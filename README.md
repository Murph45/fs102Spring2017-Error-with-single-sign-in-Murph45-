The presentation was created using the format of gregory M. kapfhammer (http://www.cs.allegheny.edu/sites/gkapfham ) where the scheme and format is similar but instead altered to focus on a different topic. By importing new pictures from another outside (flicker)while delivering the right credits to the author I was able to change the slides around to help deliver this presentation. A presentation that is different than the original. To see the outline of the presentation you can find it at (https://github.com/Murph45/fs102Spring2017-presentation1-Murph45 )

The article that i published about Google single-Sign in has a presentation which is able to be downloaded without the source code.To take a preview of the slide and how I compare it to a dangerous flower please click here [Error With Single-Sign](http://cdn.rawgit.com/Murph45/fs102Spring2017-Error-with-single-sign-in-Murph45/master/presentation1.html).
